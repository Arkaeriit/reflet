# Reflet assemblers

Two assemblers to create Reflet machine code.

This folder contains two programs, **reflet-pasm** which is a very bare-bone assembler written in C, and **reflet-masm** which is a richer assembler written mostly in Lua.

Both assemblers are case-insensitive for mnemonic but case-sensitive for anything else.

## RefletPASM
This is a pico-assembler. It can only assemble basic instructions as described in the main README.md. It would be very tedious to use it but you have total control over what instructions will be created.

If you want to insert a byte into your program without having to write the instruction for it, you can write `rawbyte` followed by a single byte in base 10.

If you want to jump to the address pointed in the working register, you can write `jmp` instead of `cpy R14`

Usage:
```
reflet-pasm <input file> <output file>
```

## RefletMASM
This is a macro-assembler. Not only can it assemble basic instructions but it can also assemble macro-instruction and manage labels. When using macro-instructions, the registers R11 and R12 might be used as temporary registers and overwritten. Furthermore, unless specified otherwise, the working registry will be modified.

To run it, the pico-assembler must be installed. 

### Usage
```
reflet-masm <input files> <options> -o <output file>
reflet-masm -help
```
The possible options are the following:

* -no-prefix: does not put the 'ASRM' prefix at the beginning of the output file.
* -no-stack-init: does not initialize the stack pointer. When not used, the stack pointer is by default initialized to just after the program.
* -set-stack-to xxx: set the stack pointer to the address given just after the flag. Incompatible with -no-stack-init.
* -start-addr xxx: tell the linker that the code should start at the given address. 
* -ignore-start: if set, the program will not start at the "start" label but at the beginning of the first input file.
* -wordsize xxx : set the wordsize to xxx (a number in bits). This overrides any information about wordsize written in the assembly file.

### Macro instructions
Macro instructions let you combine multiples instructions in one line to make your code cleaner. They are useful because the instruction size of 8 bits limits a lot what can be done with basic instructions. 

|Mnemonic|Followed by|Effect|
|--|--|--|
| set+ | A number | Put the argument number in the working register. The number can be as big as a register can hold. |
| mov | two registers | Copies the content of the second register into the first. Preserves the working register. |
| setr | a register and a number | Set the value of the given register to the given number. Preserves the working register. |
| pushr | a register | push the content of the register on the stack. |
| popr | a register | pop the top of the stack into the given register. |

### Labels
Labels can be used to jump to various parts of the program without having to calculate the address of the target instructions.

|Mnemonic|Followed by|Effect|
|--|--|--|
| label | A label | Note. the address of the following instruction as the label. |
| setlab | a label | Put the address of the label in the working register. |
| callf | a label | Call the function noted by the label. |
| goto | a label | Jumps to the label. |

The entry point of the program should be a point labeled `start`.

### Data-related macro
To write raw bytes to the output file, you can use macros that compile to `rawbyte`.

|Mnemonic|Followed by|Effect|
|--|--|--|
| rawbyte | A list of bytes in base 10 | Write in the output file the list of bytes. |
| data | a string between double quotes | Write the string to the output file |
Example:
```
label start
setlab str; We put a pointer to the strig in R1
cpy R1
callf print; We call a print function
quit

label str; We define a string
data "Hello, world!"
rawbytes 13 10 ;\r\n
rawbyte 0 ;null terminator

```

### Word size
The various macro-instructions can be compiled differently depending on the target processor's word size. Even if the code could be compatible with the various processor, using a smaller word size might not let make full use of the processor, and using a big one might create superfluous instruction. You should set the target word size by using the macro `wordsize` followed by the word size in bits in the first line of the assembly language file.

### Example
This example shows a program that adds 30 to the register R2 on a 16-bit processor in an infinite loop.
```
label start
set 0
cpy R2
label loop
set+ 30
add R2
cpy R2
setlab loop
jmp
```

# Reflet ASM Nelua

This is an old version of the assembler. Written in Nelua. It works quite well but it is very slow. Its slowness comes from it having a time complexity of about O(nÂ²) with n being the number of source lines.

## Introduction

An assembler to generate Reflet machine code. This assembler let you use labels, can do some basic linking, let you used predefined macros and even user-defined macros. As some of those macros do some basic data processing, they will use R11 and R12 as temporary registers.


## Usage

```
reflet-asm <input file> <options> -o <output file>
reflet-asm -help
```
The possible options are the following:

* -no-prefix: does not put the 'ASRM' prefix at the beginning of the output file.
* -no-stack-init: does not initialize the stack pointer. When not used, the stack pointer is by default initialized to just after the program.
* -set-stack-to xxx: set the stack pointer to the address given just after the flag. Incompatible with -no-stack-init.
* -start-addr xxx: tell the linker that the code should start at the given address. 
* -ignore-start: if set, the program will not start at the "start" label but at the beginning of the first input file.
* -word-size xxx : set the wordsize to xxx (a number in bits).
* -label-dump: if set, a dump of all labels will be printed just before linkage.

## Assembly language file

Each line can contain a line with an instruction (`add R3`), a line with no code (just white-space or a comment), an user-defined macro or an assembler directive. The various fields in an instruction or macro should not be separated by commas.

### Comments

Comments start with a semi-colon and end at the end of the line. They are ignored by the assembler.

### Instructions

Instruction start with the mnemonic for the operation and then, if the instruction needs it, an argument that can be a register, a two bit number or a four bit number. Instruction are case-insensitive.

### User-defined macros

Macros are defined in the following way:
```
@define <macro_name> <number of args>
    <content>
    <content>
@end
```

In the macro's content, arguments are accessed by calling `$<argument_number>`

In assembly, macros are called by doing `<macro_name> <arg1> <arg2> ...`

Note: The first argument is accessed with $1.

### Assembler directives

Beyond the `@define` directive to declare macros, the assembler offers other directives.

* `@label <name>` defines a position in the code.
* `@labref <name>` write in the code the address of the label with the given name.
* `@align <number>` align the next instruction to the number given in bytes.
* `@constant <number>` put the value of the number in the machine code.
* `@rawbytes <byte 1> <byte 2> ... <byte N>` writes the given bytes (in hexadecimal) in the machine code.
* `@string ...` writes the sting following the directive (and after a complementary space) in the machine code. Comments are not supported and will be considered as part of the string.
* `@import <path>` include in the assembly the content of the given file. The path is relative to the path of the file where the import directive is.
* `set8 <number>` sets the 8 bit number into the WR.

As alternatives to `@string`, there is also `@string-ln`, `@string-0`, and `@string-nl-0` which add respectively a new line, a null byte, and a new line followed by a null byte after the string.

### Predefined macro

To ease the use of the assembler, some macros are predefined.

* `set+ <number>` puts the value of the number in the working register.
* `mov <reg 1> <reg 2>` copies the value of `reg 2` into `reg 1`.
* `setr <reg> <number>` sets the value of the register to the given number. Do not preserve the working register.
* `pushr <reg>` pushes the value of the given register in the stack.
* `popr <reg>` pops the value on top of the stack in the given register.
* `label <name>` is an alias to `@label <name>`.
* `setlab <name>` sets the working register to the address of the given label.
* `callf <name>` calls the function at the given label.
* `goto <name>` jumps to the given label.
* `jmp` jumps to the address in the working register.
* `jifl <name>` jump  to the given label if the comparison bit is set to 1.
* `@set_wordsize_byte`: sets the number of bytes in a word in the working register.
* `@align_word` align to the size of the word.
* `load<bit number> <reg>` calls `load <reg>` after setting the status register to only interact with the given numbers of bits.
* `str<bit number> <reg>` calls `str <reg>` after setting the status register to only interact with the given numbers of bits.
* `rawbyte <byte>` writes a single byte (in hexadecimal) of data in the machine code.
* `addup <reg>` increase the target register with the value in the working register.
* `inc <reg>` increase by one the value in the target register.
* `inc_ws <reg>` increase by the word size in bytes the value in the target register.

Most of those macro will overwrite the register R12, only `load<X>`, `str<X>`, `setlab`, `setr`, and `set+` will overwrite R11. If you use a macro to edit the PC, it might not work and will generate unexpected behaviors.

General register manipulation macros (`mov`, `pushr`, `popr`, `addup`, `inc`, and `inc_ws`) all preserve the value of the working resister by saving it to R12. If you don't want to do so for performance reason, you can use the macros suffixed with a dot (`mov.`, `pushr.`, ...). Note that `setr` never preserves the working register.

`load<X>` and `str<X>` macros are available to work on 8, 16, or 32 bits (`load8`, `load16`, ...). They reset the status register after the store/load. If you want swifter operations on 8 bits, you can use `load8.` and `str8.` with use the `tbm` instruction. They are faster and don't use R11 or R12, but the use of `tbm` meas you can't use them in interrupt context.

## Numbers

Unless specified otherwise (like in  `@rawbytes` or `rawbyte`), number are considered to be in hexadecimal when prefixed with `0x` and in decimal otherwise.

## Registers

Registers name are case insensitive. They can either be named (`SP`, `wr`) or be written with 'R' followed by their numbers in decimal or hexadecimal (`r2`, `R0`, `r11`, `RA`). Leading zeros in registers number are not supported.

## Compilation and installation

The Reflet assember is written in [Nelua](https://nelua.io). But as everyone might not have the Nelua compiler install, I included the generated C file in this repository.

Running `make` will compile the C file. To compile from the nelua file, run `make full_compilation`.

You can then install it with `make install` or uninstall it with `make uninstall`.

## Legacy assemblers

Before writting this assembler, I had written two other that can be found in the `legacy_assemblers` folder. Note that even if they can write correct code, `reflet-masm` is not suitable to write code that is complient with alignement constrain.
